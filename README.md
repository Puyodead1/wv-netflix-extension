# Widevine Netflix Extension
This is a heavily modified version of the netflix 1080p chrome extension that enables the quality selection, and debug shortcuts and also prints tons of debug shit.<br>
Its primary use is for making metadata and manifest information available for my modified widevine l3 decryptor extension and backend downloader.<br>
TL;DR its part of my collection of tools for drm content downloading and decryption.<br>
I'm opensourcing it now since it doesnt contain any hardcoded sensitive data and it doesnt have much use without the other tools. Plus Widevine is being updated to fix the problem this stuff uses.
